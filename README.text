SWN Sector Generator
===================

A utility for use with [Stars Without Number](http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/).


## Contents
The zip file that you've unpacked contains the following items:

* This README file
* A 'GM version' of the sector that you generated
* A 'PC version' of the sector that you generated
* A star map image file (if you generated the sector in Internet Explorer)


## How to Use
Open the GM version of the sector wiki in your browser and have a look around.
In particular, check out the 'GM Info' article. It will help you to use these
pre-generated sectors to their best effect. If you aren't familiar with how
[TiddlyWiki][] works, check out the excellent documentation at the TiddlyWiki
website.

## Other Cool Things to Know
If you use any browser other than Internet Explorer to generate your sector,
you will get a version of the sector wiki where the star map image is embedded
directly in the HTML file. This is particularly useful if you own an iPad,
because then you can use the extremely cool [TWEdit][] app to view and
edit your sector wiki directly on the iPad, with a fully interactive star map.

* [Perl](http://www.perl.org/) and several freely available Perl Libraries are
  used to generate the sector and star map:
** [Archive::Zip](http://search.cpan.org/~adamk/Archive-Zip-1.30/lib/Archive/Zip.pm)
** [Cwd](http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/PathTools-3.33/Cwd.pm)
** [Data::RandomPerson](http://search.cpan.org/~peterhi/Data-RandomPerson-0.4/lib/Data/RandomPerson.pm)
** [DBI](http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI-1.616/DBI.pm)
** [GD](http://search.cpan.org/~lds/GD-2.46/GD.pm)
** [GD::Text](http://search.cpan.org/~mverb/GDTextUtil-0.86/Text.pm)
** [MIME::Base64](http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/MIME-Base64-3.13/Base64.pm)
* [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) is used to store and retrieve table data
  used throughout the wiki entries.
* Extra name generation help came directly from [Chris Pound][]'s amazing
  language generators.
